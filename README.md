Pipeline used in "Feng G, Sanderson, BJ, Keefover-Ring K, Liu J, Ma T, Yin T, Smart LB, DiFazio SP, Olson MS. 2020. Pathways to sex determination in plants: how many roads lead to Rome? Current Opinion in Plant Biology. 54: 61-68."

This pipeline apply the standard cufflinks pipleline for transcriptomics study of three species: populus, willow and asparagus. It identifys sex-biased genes by comparing RNA profiles of male and female flowers. 

Steps: pre-data processing --> mapping --> mapping results clearning -->
